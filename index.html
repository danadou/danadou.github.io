						<h2>How we met</h2>
						<p>Erin and David’s story began in Colorado Springs on a chilly November night in 2013. On that night, Erin’s friend Lilly persuaded Erin to join her for the evening at a local Colorado Springs bar, which also hosts local bands. Lilly’s husband Jamie was playing bass with the band featured that night, which happened to be made up of members of the 4th Infantry Division Band of the United States Army. David also plays in the 4th Infantry Division Band, and though he wasn’t initially planning on going out that night, he made decided to swing by and support his coworkers.</p>
						<p>When Lilly saw David walk into the bar, she decided on the spot that Erin and David needed to be together, and she made it her mission to make it happen. After an awkward introduction, Erin and David got to talking about the Midwest, their college experiences, adventures in Colorado, and their families. After watching Erin and David chat for awhile, Lilly exclaimed, “So, are you two in love yet?!” Erin jokingly declared something like, “YES! We’re totally getting married!” David was also getting some pressure to be with Erin from his friends, which only intensified when his David’s coworkers began texting him while he and Erin were right next to each other. They really wanted him to ask for Erin’s number. Erin caught on to these shenanigans and called his friends out, and she’s pretty sure that’s why he didn’t ask for her number that night.</p>
						<p>Thankfully, the story doesn’t end there. At work the following Monday, Lilly went to Erin’s classroom where they discussed all things David Love. They ended up sending David a Facebook message from Lilly’s account, which included Erin’s phone number and encouragement to seek Erin out for a date. David followed up that text with a call on Thursday, and after chatting and discussing how interesting their first meeting was, they set up a date for the weekend after Erin returned from her Thanksgiving visit in Michigan.</p>
						<p>After their first date back in 2013, Erin and David began spending most of their free time together. They’ve hiked throughout Colorado, run a few races, eaten their way through Colorado Springs, played lots of board games, and drank a bunch of craft beer. Somewhere in between all the exercise, eating, and drinking, they fell in love, and now they’re really excited to continue doing doing these activities, as well as having  many more new adventures, as a happily married couple. </p>
